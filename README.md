Start with QC.ipynb to load in the data set and perform QC.
Run calibration ctd.ipynb to calibrate the sea glider with the CTD. Then run Vertical and horizontal gridding + interpolation NaN O2 values .ipynb to grid in time and Along Track Distance and interpolate NaN Oxygen values. This will give you 2 cleaned and gridded datasets. AOU calculation Analyzation with density and depth.ipynb is used to perform analyzations combined with satelite data.
