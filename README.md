Start with QC.ipynb to load in the data set and perform QC.
Run calibration ctd.ipynb to calibrate the sea glider with the CTD. Then run backscatter.ipynb and subsequently Vertical and horizontal gridding + interpolation NaN O2 values.ipynb to grid in time and distance and interpolate NaN Oxygen values. This will give you 2 cleaned and gridded datasets, one in time and one in distance. AOU calculation Analyzation_based_on_speed_current.ipynb is used to perform analyzations combined with satelite data. Stratification.ipynb is used to calculate horizontal and vertical bx and by, EPV and geostrophic velocity
